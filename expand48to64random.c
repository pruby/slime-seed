/*
 * If no seed is provided to Minecraft when creating a world, it generates the seed with:
 * 
 *     (new Random()).nextLong()
 * 
 * This breaks down to two successive outputs of the Random() LCG, which only has
 * 48 bits of entropy. As a result, any given lower 48 bits of seed is consistent
 * on average with one 64 bit total seed - most 64 bit seeds are simply not possible.
 * 
 * This program takes 48 bit partial seeds, 1 per line, and outputs the possible 64 bit
 * seeds that could have these lower 48 bits if generated with this approach.
